🚀 Announcing LLaMA Server Compatibility Tests v0.1.0! 🧪

Help us improve llama.cpp server compatibility across different platforms! We've created a comprehensive test suite that:

✅ Validates server implementations across platforms
✅ Tests on macOS, and Windows (Linux in works)
✅ Provides detailed system metrics and test reports

How to help:
1. Clone the repo:
   https://github.com/BodhiSearch/llama-server-compat-tests
   (or download ZIP)

2. Inside the folder llama-server-comopat-tests, run the script:
   python run_tests.py

The script handles everything automatically:
- Installing dependencies
- Downloading required models
- Running compatibility tests
- Generating detailed reports

🙏 Please DM me your test report (found in reports/pytest_*.txt) along with any issues you encounter.

Your help is invaluable in ensuring Bodhi App works smoothly across all platforms! 🙌
